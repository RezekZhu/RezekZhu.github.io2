They are both parts of me, as science.\nWhen think about life, I always ask myself, life is short, so what shall I leave for this world? Here is a website where I keep a record of my thoughts, ideas, stories and life philosophies that I would like to keep.\nabout how I learn and develop\nWhy I choose this yellow-question mark-box icon as my icon of web? I’m trying to be a Super Mario in my life, to put a light weight on failure and keep going. To embrace the uncertainty, as the “?” box indicates. Here is where I got this inspiration.\nI am Gandalf the White, a renowned wizard and scholar of Middle-earth. Over the centuries, I have dedicated my life to studying the history, languages, and cultures of the peoples of Middle-earth. On this website, I offer a glimpse into my vast body of knowledge, ongoing research, and publications.\nMy research interests span the entirety of Middle-earth, from the distant past to the present day. I am particularly passionate about the languages and mythologies of the Elves, Dwarves, and Men, and I have made significant contributions to the understanding of these subjects. My studies of the natural world have also been extensive, and I am an expert in the flora and fauna of Middle-earth. Additionally, I have been involved in many important historical events and offer valuable first-hand accounts and insights on the past.\nNot only am I a scholar, but I am also a mentor and teacher. Over the centuries, I have had the honor of working with many young wizards, passing on my knowledge and experience to the next generation. I have a particular interest in the education of hobbits, whom I see as having great potential despite their small size and simple lifestyle. My teaching style is engaging and accessible, and I encourage my students to think critically and creatively.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles, monographs, and translations. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life’s work as one of Middle-earth’s greatest scholars and thinkers. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
