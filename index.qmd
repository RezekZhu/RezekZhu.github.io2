# Welcome to my website!

This website will be completed in a few days, consisting of the following three parts:

- Psychology (Science, the left half brain above)
- Photography (Art, the right half brain) 
- My life philosophy (Thoughts, the yellow question box in the center, a concept from [Super Mario](https://www.ted.com/talks/mark_rober_the_super_mario_effect_tricking_your_brain_into_learning_more)).



Currently almost all the links are replaced with a 404 page or my twitter page. I'm not gonna call it 'X' as Elon Musk wishes :( 

Btw,this cover picture is made by myself :D I loveee it!! Story behind it will also be posted in a few days.
